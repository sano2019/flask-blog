        <p><strong><em>Hi, my name is Sander. I was born and raised in the Netherlands and have been living in Stockholm, Sweden since the end of 2017.</em></strong></p>
        <p>I have a background in business & IT. For my Bachelor degree I studied Business Information Systems at the Dundalk Institute of Technology in Dundalk, Ireland. Following this I got a Master in Strategic IT Management at Stockholm University, Sweden.</p>
        <p>Since then I have worked several jobs, mostly on the edge between business and IT. It wasn't until early 2020 that I decided to pivot my career into web development.</p>
        <p>I had coded here and there before, during university and at times in my free time, but never full-time. In February 2020, I started the Le Wagon bootcamp in Stockholm as part of the first batch. The bootcamp focused on Ruby on Rails as a full-stack framework and also included a lot of concepts such as OOP, TDD and more. It laid a very good foundation for me to continue on.</p>
        <p>Since finishing the bootcamp, I have been working as a teaching assistant for the following batch, helping new students discover the wonders of Ruby, while I am looking for my first job as a full-stack developer. In addition I have been diving into React and more Javascript, which I am really enjoying.</p>
